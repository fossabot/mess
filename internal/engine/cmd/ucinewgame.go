// UCI command ucinewgame

// This is sent to the engine when the next search (started with position
// and go) will be from a different game. This can be a new game the
// engine should play or a new game it should analyze but also the next
// position from a test suite with positions only.
//
// [this clause is ignored and Mess depends on this command]
// If the GUI hasn't sent a ucinewgame before the first position command,
// the engine shouldn't expect any further ucinewgame commands as the GUI
// is probably not supporting the ucinewgame command. So the engine should
// not rely on this command even though all new GUIs should support it.
//
// As the engine's reaction to ucinewgame can take some time the GUI should
// always send isready after ucinewgame to wait for the engine to finish its
// operation.
